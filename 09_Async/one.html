<!-- // Async in javaScript -->


<!-- What is async?

The keyword async is used before a function to make it an asynchronous function.

An async function always returns a Promise, even if you return a normal value.

ðŸ”¹ Why use async?

Normally, JavaScript runs code synchronously (one line at a time).
But real-world tasks like:

Fetching data from an API,

Reading files,

Database queries,

take time. We donâ€™t want the whole program to pause/wait.
Thatâ€™s where async (with await) helps.

ðŸ”¹ Syntax
async function myFunction() {
    return "Hello";
}


âœ… This function automatically returns a Promise, like:

myFunction().then(value => console.log(value));


Output:

Hello -->
